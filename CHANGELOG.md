## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-02

First tagged release. Covers the Apple Container backend (v0.1 development)
plus the v0.2 backend and lifecycle work.

### Added

- Apple Container backend: `Run`, functional options, lifecycle (`Stop`,
  `Terminate`), connection endpoints (`Host`, `MappedPort`, `Endpoint`),
  `Exec`, `Logs`, `FollowLogs`, and file copy.
- `wait` package: log, port, HTTP, exec, and composite strategies with
  fail-fast on container exit and rollback with log tail on failure.
- Cleanup: `Cleanup` / `TerminateContainer`, session labels, `Prune`, and a
  watchdog reaper for orphaned containers (not available on Windows).
- Docker backend via CLI wrapper with OS-default selection on Linux and
  Windows; `CONTAINERGO_BACKEND` overrides on any OS.
- Automatic loopback port publishing on Docker for declared exposed ports.
- Image pull aggregation across concurrent `Run` calls; `Pull`, `PullAlways`,
  `PullNever`, and `PullMissing` policies.
- `WithReuse` get-or-create for named containers shared across tests and
  processes, with `WithReuseGroup` and `PruneReuseGroup`.
- Deferred first `inspect` until `Endpoint` or `State` is needed.
- CI: `workflow_dispatch`, `go test -race`, and Docker integration tests on
  `ubuntu-latest`.

### Changed

- English is the primary documentation language (`README.md`, `docs/design.md`).
